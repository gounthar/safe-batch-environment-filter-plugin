    The action to take when unsafe characters are detected.<p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Fail the build step</dt><!-- keep aligned with UI label -->
        <dd>
            <p>Forces the build step (and likely the job) to fail if any dangerous character is detected in any variable value. This is the <strong>safest</strong> option.</p>
            <p>
                This option can result in builds failing despite Windows Batch build steps not even using the potentially unsafe variables.
                To prevent that, combine this global option with the option <em>Only Keep Specified Environment Variables</em> of individual build steps.
                This way, only environment variables the build step actually needs would be passed to it, and unsafe values in any others would not cause the build step to fail.
            </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Redact unsafe values</dt><!-- keep aligned with UI label -->
        <dd>
            <p>Replaces each environment variable value identified as unsafe with the value <code>REDACTED</code>.</p>
            <p>This prevents command execution via environment variables,
                but it can result in unexpected behavior in scripts making use of affected environment variables.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Log warning only</dt><!-- keep aligned with UI label -->
        <dd>
            <p>Print a warning about the presence of unsafe environment variable values to the build and system logs.</p>
            <p>
                This provides <strong>no protection</strong> from unsafe environment variable values being used in Windows Batch build steps,
                but helps you understand the impact of enabling a safer option.
